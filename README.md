- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rossp-KemptVille, otherwise known as Pat Ross. I live in KemptVille Ontario small rual community and work in IT for the Government of Canada. the job is a combination of administrative, financial, and strategic advice, but I would like to get back into deveolpment as I enjoy being creative.
- 👀 I’m interested in a variety of subjects some just hobbies like my xbox, my drums which are more than just a hobby i guess since i've been playing 
-    for over 30+ years, gardening, being Italian is a natural activity, hiking, kayaking etc... 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning or re-learning CPP, SQL, Python, Swift, and basically anything else that tickles my interest. the goal is to eventually develop applications for Autisic chidlren as I have two and have realized that there is not enough tools and resoucess readily availble for families dealing with Austim.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate at some point on projects, but need to get a better understanding of SDLC which is part of overall learning,  when i'm ready ready i'll dive into the poool, just learning GIT is a curve.
